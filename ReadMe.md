# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
  This analysis serves to visualize how other Theater campaigns faired based on their launch date and their fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  Before I could start my analysis I needed to create a new column in the data extracting the years from the launch dates. From there I created a pivot table filtering the category and the years. For the rows and columns I put the launch date showing only the months and for the columns and values I set them to Outcomes. ![alt text](https://github.com/AbsoluteMorty/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Pivot%20table.png?raw=true)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
